    """
    Add patch to stage release file with validation.

    Integrates developed patch into a stage release for deployment.
    Must be run from ho-prod branch. All business logic is delegated
    to ReleaseManager with distributed lock for safe concurrent operations.

    Complete workflow:
        1. Acquire exclusive lock on ho-prod (via Git tag)
        2. Create temporary validation branch
        3. Apply all release patches + current patch
        4. Run pytest validation tests
        5. If tests pass: integrate to ho-prod
        6. If tests fail: cleanup and exit with error
        7. Send resync notifications to other patch branches
        8. Archive patch branch to ho-release/{version}/ namespace
        9. Release lock (always, even on error)

    Args:
        patch_id: Patch identifier (e.g., "456-user-auth")
        to_version: Optional explicit version (e.g., "1.3.6")
                   Required if multiple stage releases exist
                   Auto-detected if only one stage exists

    Examples:
        Add patch to auto-detected stage (one stage exists):
        $ half_orm dev add-to-release "456-user-auth"

        Add patch to specific version (multiple stages):
        $ half_orm dev add-to-release "456-user-auth" --to-version="1.3.6"

        Using short option:
        $ half_orm dev add-to-release "456" -v "1.4.0"

    Raises:
        click.ClickException: If validations fail, tests fail, or lock cannot be acquired
