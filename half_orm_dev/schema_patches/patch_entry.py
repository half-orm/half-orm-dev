"""
PatchEntry class for SchemaPatches module

Represents a single entry in the sequence file (JSON) that tracks patch metadata.
Corresponds to entries in both ho_dev_schema_patches_sequence and ho_schema_patches_sequence files.

Key Features:
- Sequence tracking within temporary keys or patch numbers
- Patch ID reference to SchemaPatches/ directories
- Application timestamp management
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Status tracking (applied/unapplied)

Usage:
    >>> entry = PatchEntry(1, "456-performance")
    >>> entry.mark_applied()
    >>> entry.is_applied()  # True
    >>> entry.to_dict()  # {'sequence': 1, 'patch_id': '456-performance', 'applied': '2025-01-15T10:30:00Z'}
