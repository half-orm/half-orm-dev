"""
Tests for ReleaseManager._detect_target_stage_file() method.

Focused on testing:
- Auto-detection when single stage exists
- Explicit version when multiple stages exist
- Error when no stage exists
- Error when multiple stages without explicit version
- Error when specified stage doesn't exist
- Edge cases with RC and production files (should be ignored)
